And by the time they're 90, they're still trying to look, you know, 30 or 20 or whatever. And it's just so obvious that it's a trap. It's a trap. And it makes you miss then all of the other stages, you know, which are just as amazing as the young stage, you know, really.

Not that he spoke it really, but he had a few words and he very generously taught them to us. I don't know, I mean I used to think that Russian writers would just... I mean what they could do is just almost unbelievable. You know, I mean in creating worlds, societies, human anguish, passion. And Tolstoy is just a master. He's a master at all of this. So, you know, I was reading him very early, is my point, and loving him very early."

And in fact, you know, one of the sadder things about him is that he raped some of the Serbs, the women who lived on basically his plantation. I mean, and he was just a dissolute, irresponsible, head of a person as a young man. And then he started seeing how it all goes, what life is. And he grew and grew and grew until he became this old man who didn't want to own anything, you know, didn't want to be married."

Well, you know, what I'm learning is that the indigenous take on everything is just so different from the Western thought. For instance, one of my favorite books is Black Elk Speaks, you know, that book. And in there, Black Elk talks about this vision that he had, you know, that everybody, they had a whole part of their culture revolved around people having visions and being guided by them. So he had this great vision, and it actually foretold, you know, the destruction of his people and all of that. But what I got from that was the other thing that he said, which is that when you are given a vision, and it's not great in terms of, you know, bigger than anybody else's, it's your great. I mean, it's like, you know, even if it's this big, it's a little bigger than, you know, so your little great vision. You have to act it out. You have to create it so that people can see it and use it. And that's how you keep it going. You can't keep it for yourself. So, I don't know the form that my vision needs to be shared."

They cut down the forest and they make these little farms and they don't last. I mean, you just see mile after mile after mile after mile of desolation. And having been in the actual Amazon, in the forest, my heart is so moved by the thought of these people coming out of the cities being given, you know, let's say 20 acres of land to clear with a machete. And they have to try to, you know, grow bananas. Because it is just like, have you been in the rain forest? Oh, it's just like, whew. I mean, I was in it. And it's never quiet. It's never quiet.
