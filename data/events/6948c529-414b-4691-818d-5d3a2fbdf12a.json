The two discuss a wide range of topics, veering into the relationship between Poets and The State, the state of Poetry in American culture in the early 2000s (as Kunitz conceived of it), Kunitz’s own life and creative practice, and his beliefs regarding interconnectedness and spirituality, what he called “the web of creation.”"
