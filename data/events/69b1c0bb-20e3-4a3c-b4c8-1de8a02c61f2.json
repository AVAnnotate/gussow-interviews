Most of the interview regards Mokae’s relationship with fellow South African playwright, director and actor Athol Fugard (1932-2025). Topics discussed include the difficulties of creating theater involving both black and white actors under the Apartheid regime, Fugard’s style as a director and actor, Mokae’s personal relationship with Fugard during their early careers, and Mokae’s continued work as an actor now living in America. The production and biographical aspects of Fugard’s plays are also heavily discussed, particularly The Blood Knot and Master Harold and the Boys. "
